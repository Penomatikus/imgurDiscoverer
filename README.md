# imgurDiscoverer
The known image hoster and image based community does not provide full privacy protection to its hosted images. The program will exploit this circumstance and generates random hashes which may be a valid image name and displays all those in a user friendly GUI.

### Customizable program settings  
* Threads: Choose between 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 threads. A single thread handels the generation of hashes, thoose validation and download task. Use more, if you want faster results. However, be carefull. Imgur might notice your heavy connection rate to their server and temporary blocks your IP.
* Maximum megabytes ( mb ) to download: Choose between 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 or 550 megabytes as maximum download size in total. Is this limit reached, all current download tasks will finish and no new one will start.
* Generated hashes to file: Choose if the found and / or not found hashes should be written into a file, after a download session. You might want to reuse them for other purposes. Moreover, the directory for storing can be changed.
* Images to file: A found images will be saved in a custom directory. By default, this is the systems tmp directory. Since the total data size of downloaded images will be accumulate per download session, this directory should not be changed. Choose the images you want to save per single click on their thumbnail and use the save button on the upper hand of the program. This will open a new dialog for choosing a directory to copy them to. 
* Don't download images: In case your system running on low resources or you don't want to waste space on your hard disk, you have the possibility to let the program only check if a certian image (hash) does exists on the server. Then no single image will be downloaded and an empty thumbnail will be added with the hash as description.
